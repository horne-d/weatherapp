# Weather App

https://horne-d.github.io/weatherapp/

This was another small app made to help me dive deeper into React, and what can be achieved with it.

This is optimised for mobile screen sizes, so I recommend setting the screen to a mobile size, by either reducing the width or amending in Chrome dev tools.

Simply enter your city/location in the input at the top, and this will display the weather currently.

I used the openweather api to set this up - https://openweathermap.org/
